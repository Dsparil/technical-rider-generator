## About Gevaudan's Technical Rider Generator

This website strips your band from the extreme annoyance of writing a technical rider from scratch.
You provide the info, we organize it and print it out like a pro.
Just upload your logo, configure, place objects on a scene map, export to PDF, then you're all set to go on stage !

Features
- Multiple riders can be created and printed out, depending on the scene configuration of your host. Available anytime and anywhere. Don't wanna start over for each new place you play at ? Just copy the old one, then edit it !
- Scene mapper : just drag and drop pre-drawn objects on the map, and there you go. No need to draw a scene map by yourself !
- Patch list editor, an easy to use and intuitive IU for patchlist entries : add, remove, move up & down...
- Stuff manager : there is no better way to tell your host what you will need and what you will provide. Will also help keeping track on what you could forget when you're leaving !
- Band info : a list of essential intel to provide your host about your band. Everything will be organized and written down on the technical rider.
- Custom page : tell your host how you want to be greeted, with the help of pre-written templates you can adjust to your needs.
